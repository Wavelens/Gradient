# Gradient

Gradient is a web-based Nix-based Continuous Integration (CI) system.

This project is currently in the early stages of development. We are working on the initial implementation and documentation. If you are interested in contributing, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Features (planned)

- **GitHub Like UI**: has a clean and intuitive user interface that is inspired by GitHub Actions.
- **Organizations**: multiple organizations, which work independently from each other (e.g. different servers, user access).
- **API**: provides a RESTful API with API-Key management for authentication.
- **Streaming Logs**: real-time log streaming for builds.
- **Rich Project Configuration**: check all branches, pull requests, and tags.
